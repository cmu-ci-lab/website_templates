# Website templates for CIRL

This repository provides templates for:
* personal websites under `personal` ([example](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~igkioule/)),
* paper websites under `paper` ([example](https://imaging.cs.cmu.edu/volumetric_opaque_solids/)),
* course websites under `course` ([example](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-463/)),
* tutorial websites under `tutorial` ([example](https://imaging.cs.cmu.edu/pbr_cvpr2023/)).

The website templates are designed to provide a clean and modern template with minimal Javascript, and validated [HTML5](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://validator.w3.org/) code. The templates make use of [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons, and [TwentyTwenty](https://github.com/zurb/twentytwenty) and [model-viewer](https://modelviewer.dev/) for visualizations.

Even though these website templates are designed for the [Carnegie Mellon computational imaging](https://imaging.cs.cmu.edu/) lab, they may be useful to other academics. You are welcome to use them, but if you do make sure to:
* replace details specific to the Carnegie Mellon computational imaging (for example, favicon) as appropriate,
* use your own Font Awesome kit,
* if possible, add an acknowledgment to this repository!
