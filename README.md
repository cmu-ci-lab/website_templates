# Website templates for CIRL

This repository provides templates for:
* personal websites under `personal` ([example](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~igkioule/)),
* paper websites under `paper` ([example](https://imaging.cs.cmu.edu/volumetric_opaque_solids/)),
* course websites under `course` ([example](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-463/)),
* tutorial websites under `tutorial` ([example](https://imaging.cs.cmu.edu/pbr_cvpr2023/)).

The website templates are designed to provide a clean and consistent layout using minimal Javascript and validated semantic [HTML5](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://validator.w3.org/) code. The templates make use of [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons, and [TwentyTwenty](https://github.com/zurb/twentytwenty) and [model-viewer](https://modelviewer.dev/) for visualizations.

Even though these website templates are designed for the [Carnegie Mellon computational imaging](https://imaging.cs.cmu.edu/) lab, they may be useful to other academics and researchers. You are welcome to use them, but if you do please make sure to:
* replace details specific to the Carnegie Mellon computational imaging lab (for example, favicon) as appropriate,
* use your own Font Awesome kit,
* if possible, add an acknowledgment to this repository!

### Figures

Figures in the templates (for example, teasers) are from the example websites linked above. You should make sure to replace them with your own. To match the website width and font, your figures should have a width of `708em` and use the Lato regular font with size `10.8pt`. We recommend using `SVG` figures.

To help you create your own figures, the folder `assets` contains:
* an Adobe Illustrator template you can use to create figures that are compatible with the website width and font, 
* original files for the logo of the Carnegie Mellon computational imaging lab (originally by [Yi Hua](https://hawaiii.github.io/)).
